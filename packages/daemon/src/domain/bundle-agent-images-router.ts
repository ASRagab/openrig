/**
 * Bundle agent_images router (Item 6 / slice-05 Checkpoint 7.3g step 2).
 *
 * Pure function. Copies agent-image directories declared in a bundle
 * manifest's agent_images[] block from the bundle's extracted tree to the
 * operator agent-images library. No daemon dependencies — fully
 * unit-testable via FsOps injection.
 *
 * Per PRD §Item 6 line 197: agent_images entries are paths to the
 * agent-image DIRECTORY (not manifest paths — distinct shape from
 * context_packs per the e7a0b253 PRD-coherent repair). The router copies
 * the declared directory to <targetAgentImagesDir>/<basename(sourceAbs)>/
 * — the operator-host canonical layout per agent-image-types.ts:9-10.
 *
 * Consumer contract (agent-image-library-service.ts:77-95): the consumer
 * walks roots whose immediate children are image DIRS, requires each
 * image dir to be a directory + contain a manifest.yaml FILE. The router
 * enforces these consumer-visibility invariants at copy time so
 * routedCount stays truthful at the consumer-visible boundary.
 *
 * All four banked router-level catches from the context_packs cycle
 * (d491eca9 + 3cd581e3 + 16ebb8af + a0e7e0e1) apply identically and are
 * built in from the first commit:
 *   1. source path containment (mirrors all sibling routers)
 *   2. sourceAbs exists + isDirectory (declared path IS the image dir)
 *   3. manifest.yaml inside exists AS A FILE (consumer requires
 *      readable manifest.yaml; rejects manifest-missing AND manifest-
 *      is-a-directory cases — file-vs-dir discrimination axis)
 *   4. basename(sourceAbs) collision detection (first wins, second
 *      flagged status=conflict)
 *
 * /install handler integration lands at Checkpoint 7.3g step 3 with a
 * real consumer-scan() proof against the routed dir (mirror of the
 * cb0bf7b9 context_packs ContextPackLibraryService.scan reachability
 * proof).
